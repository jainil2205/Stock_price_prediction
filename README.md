#Stock Price Prediction with LSTM using Keras
Overview
This project aims to predict the stock prices of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model implemented with Keras. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, making it suitable for time series forecasting such as stock price prediction.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
Dataset
For this project, historical stock price data for TCS is used. The dataset should include features such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Ensure that the dataset is split into training and testing sets.

Model Architecture
The LSTM model is implemented using the Keras library. The architecture may include one or more LSTM layers followed by a Dense layer for output. The choice of hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, units, learning rate) depends on experimentation and tuning.

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_steps, n_features)))
model.add(Dense(units=1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the data by normalizing the values, handling missing values, and creating sequences for the LSTM model. This step is crucial for the model to learn meaningful patterns from the data.

python
Copy code
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dropout, Dense

model = Sequential()

model.add(LSTM(units=50, activation='relu', return_sequences=True, input_shape=(x_train.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))

model.add(LSTM(units=60, activation='relu', return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(0.3))

model.add(LSTM(units=80, activation='relu', return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(0.4))

model.add(LSTM(units=120, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))

model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='linear'))  # Adjusted the output layer for regression

# Compile the model (add optimizer and loss function based on your task)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')  # Adjust optimizer and loss function as needed

Training the Model
Train the LSTM model on the training data using the fit method. Monitor the training process to ensure convergence and prevent overfitting.


model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
Evaluation
Evaluate the model on the testing set to assess its performance. Use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify the prediction accuracy.
